ğŸ§± What is a Monotonic Stack?

A monotonic stack is a stack (LIFO data structure) that maintains its elements in either increasing or decreasing order.

Monotonic Increasing Stack: Elements increase from top to bottom
ğŸ‘‰ Good for finding next smaller elements

Monotonic Decreasing Stack: Elements decrease from top to bottom
ğŸ‘‰ Good for finding next greater elements
---------------------------------------------------
âœ… Why use it?

To efficiently solve problems like:

Next Greater Element

Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Trapping Rain Water

Sliding Window Maximum

Daily Temperatures

Instead of O(nÂ²) brute force, you get O(n) time!
---------------------------------------------------
ğŸ’¡ Key Idea

You iterate through the array and maintain a stack such that it preserves a monotonic order.
As you go, you pop from the stack until the order is restored â€” this is how you discard elements you don't need.
